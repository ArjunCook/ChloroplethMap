# ChloroplethMap
COVID-19 Chloropleth Map

I tried making the map, but was having major trouble cloning the proper repository as my repository had cloned one from earlier in class before it was updated. After I figured out the proper repository, I followed the tutorial on the Choropleth map and Mapbox woulnd't work, even with the access token and after making mutiple accounts. This would also create more issues for me in the next lab, which was dependent on Mapbox and tiling. I am sorry, I just couldn't figure out many basic steps. When I pasted in certain code on VSCode, it wouldn't work, and figuring out command lines for my 2012 MacBook was painful. Again, I really did try my best.
